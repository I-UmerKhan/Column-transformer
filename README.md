# Column-transformer
I learned how to use the ColumnTransformer from sklearn, which greatly simplifies the coding process. The ColumnTransformer allows for the application of different preprocessing steps to specific columns within a single, streamlined workflow. This not only makes the code more concise and readable but also ensures that preprocessing steps are consistently applied, reducing the potential for errors and improving overall efficiency in the data transformation process.
